  <h1>Dealership Management System (DMS) ‚Äì End-to-End SDLC Project</h1>
  <p><strong>Role:</strong> Project Manager ¬∑ Business Analyst ¬∑ Developer</p>

  <p>
    This project involved designing and prototyping a custom Dealership Management System (DMS) for a small used car dealership struggling with inefficient inventory tracking, manual document handling, and a lack of business insights. I took the project from the planning phase all the way to a working prototype, covering the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
  </p>

  <h2>üìå 1. Project Planning</h2>
  <p>
    The first step was creating a project charter to define scope, stakeholders, goals, and timeline. The dealership‚Äôs main pain points were identified through interviews and process observation. A high-level project schedule was created to manage phases from discovery to prototyping.

  <h2>üîç 2. Requirements Gathering & Current State Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    I documented the dealership‚Äôs existing workflows using BPMN diagrams to capture the ‚Äúas-is‚Äù process. This revealed inefficiencies in manual data entry, document filing, and a complete absence of reporting or analytics.

  <h2>üõ†Ô∏è 3. Process Redesign & Future-State Modeling</h2>
  <p>
    Based on identified gaps, I proposed a redesigned ‚Äúto-be‚Äù workflow that introduced digital recordkeeping, automated calculations, and streamlined document management. This became the foundation for the system‚Äôs core features.

  <h2>üß± 4. System Design & Database Modeling</h2>
  <p>
    I designed a relational database schema to store vehicles, financials, documents, and sales history. The schema supported normalized relationships and enabled robust filtering for reports.

  <h2>üß™ 5. Prototype Development</h2>
  <p>
    I developed a functional web-based prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system included features such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Vehicle lookup by VIN with autofill</li>
    <li>Document upload linked to vehicle records</li>
    <li>Automated expense and profit calculations</li>
    <li>Custom reporting with filters by make, date, and status</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üí° Reflections</h2>
  <p>
    This project was a valuable hands-on experience in full-cycle software development, from problem definition to prototype. It demonstrated my ability to combine business analysis with system design and frontend development ‚Äî all while keeping the end-user experience in focus.
  </p>

  <p>
    In future iterations, I would expand the prototype with backend functionality, authentication, and persistent storage using a framework like Flask or Node.js. I would also incorporate user testing and feedback loops to further refine the system.
